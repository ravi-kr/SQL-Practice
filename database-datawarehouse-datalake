Database Vs Datawarehouse Vs Data Lake

Database - Transactional data OLTP (Online transaction processing)
Structured data
Recent data - day to day data
Example - Online banking transaction
Oracle, MySQL
Schema on write

create table employee(
	empid number,
	empname string,
	salary number
)

insert into employee (...)

If there is any mismatch with the structure then We will get an error.
The cost to store the data in database is high.

Data warehouse DWH

Analytical processing where we require a lot of historical data to find the insights.

The moment we run complex queries on our database with an intent to do some analysis then our day to day transactions will become slow.

We take the data from databases and migrate it to datawarehouse to do analytical processing.

We get the data from multiple sources.

Structured data - Schema on write.

Teradata

Storage cost is high but lesser than database

ETL process - 

Suppose your data is in database
extract the data
Transform the data (it is a complex process)
Load it to datawarehouse
This approach reduces our flexibility.

Data Lake

To get insights from huge amount of data.
The data is present in its raw form. It can be structured or unstructured.

Log file - We can directly have this file in raw form in datalake.

ELT process - Extract load and then transform.

HDFS, S3

Cost effective

Schema on READ

employee.csv

create structure to visualize or see the data.

It gives you enough flexibility.
